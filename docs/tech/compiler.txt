Compiler

For the project, we use the gcc compiler suite.

The gcc compiler is a command line tool and is a very common compiler 
and is usuable on every popular platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux). 

Some of the main command line flags are (case-sensitive, and prepended with "-"):
    - Wall - turns on all warnings 
    - Werror - turns all warnings into errors, which will not allow compilation
    - pedantic - makes code more portable by warning about things that aren't in every standard.
    - std=VERSION - sets the standard for the compiler to reference the code against
    - o FILENAME - outputs the final executable to the file: FILENAME
    - c - only compiles into object files
        - This is very useful for large projects, when you compile this way
          only modified files will be recompiled (in conjunction with make)
    - lLIBRARY_NAME - this will link a library to the executable 
                    - for this project we will need the math library at least

Any other options should be out of the scope of this project.
More options can be found here: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html
But it would probably be more useful to google any options you may need.

Quadratic equation

The quadratic equation follows the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

To solve for x, one can use the formula:

x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2a)

A few notes about the equation:
	- a = 0 is not valid as it will cause divison by 0
	- The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must not be negative or it will not be a real number
	- There will be two solutions (x1 and x2) as there is a square root in the equation

Example valid inputs:
	- a = 2; b = 9; c = 5
	- a = 3; b = 5; c = 2

Example invalid inputs:
	- a = 0; b = 9; c = 5
		- a = 0
	- a = 1; b = 1; c = 1
		- Discriminant would be negative
